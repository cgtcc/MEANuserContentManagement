# nodejs-cms

This is a CMS base one can use as a skeleton app to quickly create a mokup application, for testing and demonstration purpose.
Please note at this time, only basic functions are working and the script is not ready for production.

<h3>Development environment instructions</h3>
Check to confirm you have NodeJS >= 6 installed and mongodb is running.
<code>npm install | npm install -g nodemon<br/>
<code>nodemon server</code>
<p>...enjoy :)</p>

<h3>TODO (short term roadmap) before using this script</h3>
- implement JWE
- remove any nominal information from JWE and fetch from MongoDb instead
- add CRUD operations to create / read / update / delete the site content, and user attached objects
